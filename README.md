A simple, beginener friendly pizza, steak and sushi classifying AI!

## About the Project:
What began as a straightforward endeavor formed out of boredom developed into a fascinating voyage of discovery, education, and creativity. The pizza, sushi, and steak classifier, which is designed to anticipate them, is an example of how AI may be used to perform image recognition and classification tasks. **This** **project serves as a** **beginner-friendly** introduction to the fascinating area of artificial intelligence and its use in computer vision by reducing the dataset and offering a simple methodology. I hope that my endeavor encourages people to start their own AI projects, exploring novel ideas and turning boredom into a creative force.


## **TO DO:**
1. Maybe convert it to `.py`?
2. Create a requirements.txt file.
