# FoodModel
Just some side project ig.. It performs badly as **the model is in trial and error stage.**


turns out i have to add info about the "side project". so uh... this is a project??? something im working on cuz im bored (again). Anywayss

The model is made using PyTorch and uh yeah idk what else to add. If you get any issues or smth else lmk!

buh byee<3

P.S. Actual readme file coming later <3

## **TO DO:**
1. Get a good performing model from training.
2. Create different files, one for training the model and the other for using the model to predict the food images from data.
3. Maybe convert it to `.py`?
